## Guidance for Executing the Projects

### 1. Generating Synthetic Data

* **Develop Python Scripts:**

  * Generate the dataset section by section.

    * Start with the primary entity (e.g., participant information).
    * Then proceed to dependent sections (e.g., lifestyle, health conditions).
* **Ensure Realism:**

  * The data should closely resemble real-world patterns.
  * Align the generated data with the stated project expectations and outcomes.
* **Maintain Logical Consistency:**

  * For example:

    * A person who has never suffered from allergies should not show allergies to eggs.
    * A lifelong non-smoker should not be recorded as smoking 10 cigarettes a day.

### 2. Purposeful Data Visualization

* Generate plots that serve a clear investigative purpose.
* Each plot should directly contribute to addressing the project’s objectives.

### 3. Findings and Observations

* Include a **Findings Section** under each plot.

  * Summarize the **key insights or patterns** revealed by that visualization.

### 4. Summary of Observations

* At the end of the report, add a **Summary Section** that consolidates the key insights drawn from the entire dataset.

### 5. Recommendations

* Based on the summary, provide **actionable recommendations** for relevant stakeholders.
* Ensure these recommendations are directly tied to the observations presented earlier.

### 6. Separation of Documents

* Maintain separate files for:

  * Programs generating the plots.
  * Programs used to generate synthetic data (kept outside the main report).

### 7. Reporting on Synthetic Data

* Do **not** include the synthetic data generation programs in the final report.
* Instead, add a **disclaimer** at the end stating that:

  > “This report is based on synthetic data, modeled to reflect real-life situations.”

### 8. File Organization

* Keep the following clearly separated:

  * Synthetic data generation programs.
  * Synthetic data files.
  * Individual or Grouped plot generation programs
  * Final reporting document.
