# 📊 Mann-Whitney U Test Cases

*(From Basic → Advanced Complexity)*

The **Mann-Whitney U Test** (also called Wilcoxon rank-sum test) is a **non-parametric alternative to the independent t-test**, used when assumptions of normality aren’t met. It compares whether **two independent groups differ significantly** on a continuous or ordinal dependent variable.

# ✅ Step-by-Step Structure for Students

For each case, students should follow this procedure:

1. **State Hypotheses**

   * H₀: There is no difference in the distributions of the two groups.
   * H₁: The distributions of the two groups are different.

2. **Check Assumptions**

   * DV is at least ordinal
   * Independent groups
   * Randomly sampled participants

3. **Rank the Data**

   * Combine both groups → rank all scores together
   * Handle ties with average ranks

4. **Calculate the Mann-Whitney U**

   * Compute U for both groups
   * Use the smaller U as the test statistic

5. **Obtain p-value**

   * From statistical table or software

6. **Decision Rule**

   * If p ≤ 0.05 → Reject H₀
   * If p > 0.05 → Fail to reject H₀

7. **Interpret Results**

   * State whether there’s a significant difference between groups
   * Explain findings in real-world terms
