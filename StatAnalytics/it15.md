# 📊 15 Pearson Correlation Test Cases

*(From Basic → Advanced Complexity)*

**Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient (r)** measures the **strength and direction of a linear relationship between two continuous variables**. It assumes both variables are interval/ratio scale and normally distributed.

## **Level 1: Basic Everyday Contexts**

1. **Hours Studied vs Exam Scores**

   * Variables: Hours studied and exam marks (%)

2. **Daily Exercise vs Resting Heart Rate**

   * Variables: Minutes of daily exercise and resting heart rate (bpm)

3. **Age vs Number of Social Media Apps Used**

   * Variables: Age in years and number of social media apps actively used

## **Level 2: Lifestyle & Health**

4. **Sleep Duration vs Productivity**

   * Variables: Hours of sleep and productivity score (1–100 scale)

5. **Daily Water Intake vs Skin Hydration Rating**

   * Variables: Liters of water consumed daily and skin hydration rating (1–10)

6. **Monthly Income vs Monthly Expenditure**

   * Variables: Monthly income (in ₹) and monthly spending (in ₹)

---

## **Level 3: Education & Social Contexts**

7. **Class Attendance vs Final Grade**

   * Variables: Percentage of classes attended and final exam score (%)

8. **Reading Hours vs Vocabulary Test Score**

   * Variables: Weekly reading hours and vocabulary test marks

9. **Number of Friends vs Happiness Score**

   * Variables: Count of close friends and self-reported happiness (1–10)

---

## **Level 4: Applied Research**

10. **Blood Pressure vs Age**

    * Variables: Age (years) and systolic blood pressure (mmHg)

11. **Weight vs Cholesterol Level**

    * Variables: Body weight (kg) and cholesterol level (mg/dL)

12. **Study Time vs Stress Level**

    * Variables: Hours spent studying per week and stress score (scale 1–20)

---

## **Level 5: Advanced / Complex Research**

13. **Work Experience vs Salary**

    * Variables: Years of work experience and monthly salary (₹)

14. **Air Pollution vs Respiratory Health Score**

    * Variables: PM2.5 concentration (µg/m³) and respiratory health score

15. **Screen Time vs Sleep Quality**

    * Variables: Daily screen time (hours) and sleep quality rating (1–10)

# ✅ Step-by-Step Structure for Students

For each case, students should follow this procedure:

1. **State Hypotheses**

   * H₀: ρ = 0 (no linear correlation between the two variables)
   * H₁: ρ ≠ 0 (there is a linear correlation)

2. **Check Assumptions**

   * Both variables continuous (interval/ratio).
   * Normal distribution of variables.
   * Linear relationship (scatterplot check).
   * No extreme outliers.

3. **Compute Pearson’s r**

   * Formula:

     $$
     r = \frac{\sum (x - \bar{x})(y - \bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum (x - \bar{x})^2 \sum (y - \bar{y})^2}}
     $$

4. **Obtain p-value**

   * Test significance of r using t-test:

     $$
     t = r \sqrt{\frac{n - 2}{1 - r^2}}
     $$

     with df = n – 2

5. **Decision Rule**

   * If p ≤ 0.05 → Reject H₀
   * If p > 0.05 → Fail to reject H₀

6. **Interpret Results**

   * Direction: Positive (both increase), Negative (one increases, other decreases)
   * Strength:

     * 0.00–0.19 = Very weak
     * 0.20–0.39 = Weak
     * 0.40–0.59 = Moderate
     * 0.60–0.79 = Strong
     * 0.80–1.0 = Very strong

7. **Visualize**

   * Draw a scatterplot with regression line to confirm linearity.
