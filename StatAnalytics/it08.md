# 📊 Cases for Chi-Square Test

### (From Simple to Complex)

The **Chi-Square test** is a non-parametric test, generally used for **categorical data**. There are two major types:

1. **Chi-Square Goodness-of-Fit Test** (does a sample match a population distribution?)
2. **Chi-Square Test of Independence** (are two categorical variables independent?)
3. **Chi-Square Test of Homogeneity** (do different populations have the same distribution of a categorical variable?)

## 🔹 Part A: Goodness-of-Fit (Comparing Observed vs Expected)

**1. Coin Toss Fairness**
A coin is tossed 50 times: Heads = 28, Tails = 22. Test if the coin is fair at α = 0.05.

**2. Dice Fairness**
A die is rolled 120 times. Observed frequencies: {1: 18, 2: 20, 3: 22, 4: 21, 5: 19, 6: 20}. Test if the die is fair at α = 0.05.

**3. Favorite Ice Cream Flavors**
A shop claims customers prefer Chocolate, Vanilla, and Strawberry equally. Out of 90 customers: Chocolate = 40, Vanilla = 25, Strawberry = 25. Test the claim at α = 0.05.

**4. Distribution of Blood Groups**
In a town, blood groups are distributed as A: 30%, B: 25%, O: 35%, AB: 10%. Among 200 people, observed: A: 58, B: 52, O: 70, AB: 20. Test at α = 0.05.

**5. Choice of Transport Mode**
It is believed that 25% of people use buses, 25% use trains, 25% use cars, and 25% walk. In a survey of 200: Bus = 40, Train = 60, Car = 70, Walk = 30. Test at α = 0.05.

## 🔹 Part B: Test of Independence (Two-Way Contingency Tables)

**6. Gender vs Favorite Sport**
Survey of 100 students:

* Males: Football = 20, Cricket = 15, Basketball = 15
* Females: Football = 10, Cricket = 20, Basketball = 20
  Test if gender and sport preference are independent at α = 0.05.

**7. Education Level vs Internet Usage**
Survey of 150 people:

* High School: Low = 20, Medium = 30, High = 25
* College: Low = 15, Medium = 25, High = 35
* Postgraduate: Low = 10, Medium = 20, High = 20
  Test if education level affects internet usage at α = 0.05.

**8. Smoking vs Lung Disease**
200 people surveyed:

* Smokers: Disease = 30, No Disease = 70
* Non-Smokers: Disease = 20, No Disease = 80
  Test at α = 0.05.

**9. Customer Satisfaction vs Service Type**
Survey of 180 customers:

* Online Service: Satisfied = 50, Neutral = 20, Dissatisfied = 30
* In-Store Service: Satisfied = 40, Neutral = 15, Dissatisfied = 25
  Test independence at α = 0.05.

**10. Age Group vs Exercise Frequency**
Sample of 200 people:

* 18–30: Regular = 40, Occasional = 20, Never = 30
* 31–50: Regular = 30, Occasional = 25, Never = 25
* 51+: Regular = 20, Occasional = 15, Never = 15
  Test at α = 0.05.

## 🔹 Part C: Homogeneity / Larger & More Complex Scenarios

**11. Political Party Preference in Two Cities**
Survey of 240 people:

* City A: Party X = 40, Y = 50, Z = 30
* City B: Party X = 35, Y = 45, Z = 40
  Test if preferences differ across cities at α = 0.05.

**12. Defective vs Non-Defective Products by Machine**
Factory uses 3 machines. Out of 300 products:

* Machine A: Defective = 10, Non-defective = 90
* Machine B: Defective = 20, Non-defective = 80
* Machine C: Defective = 25, Non-defective = 75
  Test if defect rate depends on the machine at α = 0.05.

**13. Voting Preference by Education Level**
300 voters:

* High School: Candidate A = 40, B = 60
* College: Candidate A = 50, B = 50
* Postgraduate: Candidate A = 70, B = 30
  Test if voting preference depends on education at α = 0.01.

**14. Brand Preference by Age Group**
Survey of 400 customers:

* Under 30: Brand A = 40, B = 60, C = 50
* Age 30–50: Brand A = 50, B = 70, C = 40
* Age 51+: Brand A = 30, B = 50, C = 60
  Test at α = 0.05.

**15. Treatment Effectiveness Across Hospitals**
Three hospitals treat 300 patients:

* Hospital 1: Recovered = 70, Not Recovered = 30
* Hospital 2: Recovered = 80, Not Recovered = 20
* Hospital 3: Recovered = 65, Not Recovered = 35
  Test if recovery rates differ by hospital at α = 0.01.

# ✅ Step-by-Step Framework for Students

For **each case**:

1. **State the hypotheses**

   * H₀: The observed distribution fits the expected distribution (Goodness-of-fit) OR the two variables are independent (Independence).
   * H₁: The observed distribution does not fit the expected distribution OR the two variables are dependent.

2. **Set the significance level (α)**

3. **Compute expected frequencies**

   * Goodness-of-Fit: $E_i = \text{Total} \times \text{Expected Proportion}$
   * Independence:

   $$E_{ij} = \frac{(\text{Row Total})(\text{Column Total})}{\text{Grand Total}}$$

4. **Compute the Chi-Square statistic**

   $$\chi^2 = \sum \frac{(O - E)^2}{E}$$

5. **Degrees of freedom**

   * Goodness-of-fit: df = k − 1 (k = categories)
   * Independence: df = (rows − 1) × (columns − 1)

6. **Find critical value** from Chi-Square table using df & α.

7. **Decision rule**

   * Reject H₀ if χ² > critical value (or p < α).

8. **Conclusion in plain language**
