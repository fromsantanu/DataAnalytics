# 📊 15 Cases of One-Sample T-Test

### (From Simple to Complex)

---

## 🔹 Basic Level (Small Samples, Direct Hypothesis Tests)

**1. Average Study Hours**
A teacher believes students study 3 hours per day on average. A sample of 12 students shows a mean of 3.5 hours with sample SD = 0.8 hours. Test at α = 0.05.

**2. Weight of Sugar Packets**
A sugar company claims its 1 kg packets are accurate. A sample of 10 packets has a mean of 0.97 kg, SD = 0.05 kg. Test at α = 0.05.

**3. Daily Sleep of College Students**
The national average sleep for adults is 7 hours. A sample of 15 college students reports an average of 6.6 hours, SD = 0.9. Test at α = 0.05.

**4. Speed of Typing**
A company claims its secretaries type 50 words per minute. A sample of 9 secretaries has a mean speed of 48 WPM, SD = 3. Test at α = 0.05.

**5. Average Test Score**
A class is expected to score 70 on a test. A sample of 16 students scores a mean of 73 with SD = 8. Test at α = 0.01.

## 🔹 Moderate Level (Applied Real-World Scenarios)

**6. Commute Time of Workers**
The average commute in a city is 40 minutes. A sample of 20 workers has a mean of 37 minutes, SD = 5. Test at α = 0.05.

**7. Coffee Fill in a Café**
A café promises its coffee mugs hold 250 ml. A sample of 18 mugs gives a mean of 246 ml, SD = 6 ml. Test at α = 0.05.

**8. Heart Rate of Athletes**
The resting heart rate of healthy adults is 72 bpm. A sample of 22 athletes shows a mean of 68 bpm, SD = 5. Test at α = 0.01.

**9. Average IQ of Students**
The IQ of the general population is 100. A sample of 14 students in a special program has a mean IQ of 107, SD = 10. Test at α = 0.05.

**10. Lifespan of New Bulbs**
A brand claims bulbs last 800 hours. A sample of 25 bulbs has a mean life of 780 hours, SD = 50. Test at α = 0.05.

## 🔹 Advanced Level (Larger Samples, Subtle Mean Differences)

**11. Daily Screen Time**
Parents claim teens spend 5 hours/day on screens. A sample of 30 teens shows a mean of 5.4 hours, SD = 0.9. Test at α = 0.05.

**12. Customer Satisfaction Rating**
A hotel claims its satisfaction score is 8.0/10. A survey of 28 customers gives a mean of 7.6, SD = 0.7. Test at α = 0.01.

**13. Blood Pressure in Patients**
Normal systolic blood pressure is 120 mmHg. A sample of 35 patients on a new diet has a mean of 116, SD = 9. Test at α = 0.05.

**14. Exam Performance in Two Semesters (Before vs Hypothetical Standard)**
A professor believes her new teaching method improves average scores beyond the previous standard of 65. A sample of 25 students scores a mean of 68, SD = 6. Test at α = 0.05.

**15. Average Monthly Spending**
The average monthly spending of households is estimated to be \$1,200. A survey of 40 households finds a mean of \$1,160 with SD = 100. Test at α = 0.01.

# ✅ Suggested Step-by-Step Format for Students

For each case, students should follow:

1. **State the hypotheses**

   * H₀: μ = μ₀
   * H₁: μ ≠ μ₀ (two-tailed) OR μ > μ₀ / μ < μ₀ (one-tailed)

2. **Set the significance level (α)**

3. **Compute the test statistic**

   $$t = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{s / \sqrt{n}}$$

   * where s = sample standard deviation

4. **Determine degrees of freedom (df)**

   $$df = n - 1$$

5. **Find the critical t-value** from the t-distribution table (based on df and α).

6. **Decision rule**

   * Reject H₀ if |t| > tcritical

7. **Conclusion in plain language**
