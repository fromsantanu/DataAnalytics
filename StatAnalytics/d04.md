## ðŸ“Œ 15 Cases for Solving with Standardization

1. **Comparing Exam Scores Across Subjects**

   * A student scores 80 in Mathematics (mean = 70, SD = 5) and 75 in English (mean = 60, SD = 12). Which subject did the student perform better in relative to peers?

2. **Height Comparison Across Different Age Groups**

   * A 10-year-old boy is 135 cm tall. To check if his growth is above average, his height is standardized against the mean and SD of boys his age.

3. **Employee Productivity Across Departments**

   * Department A produces an average of 200 units (SD = 20), while Department B averages 150 units (SD = 15). Standardization helps compare employeesâ€™ productivity fairly across departments.

4. **Detecting Outliers in Salary Data**

   * HR wants to identify unusually high or low salaries in a company. Z-scores are computed to flag outliers beyond Â±3 standard deviations.

5. **Comparing Investment Returns Across Markets**

   * A 7% return in the U.S. stock market vs. a 12% return in the Indian stock market: standardization adjusts for volatility (SD) to determine which is better on a risk-adjusted basis.

6. **Standardizing Test Scores for College Admissions**

   * Candidates from different schools take different grading systems. Their scores are standardized to a common scale before selection.

7. **Evaluating Blood Pressure Readings Across Age Groups**

   * A patientâ€™s systolic blood pressure is compared with age-adjusted norms using z-scores to determine if itâ€™s significantly high.

8. **Comparing Cricket Playersâ€™ Batting Averages Across Seasons**

   * A playerâ€™s batting average this season vs. last season can be compared after standardizing for league-wide mean and variability.

9. **Assessing Performance in Competitive Sports**

   * Two athletes compete in different sports (running and swimming). Standardization allows comparison of their results relative to competitors.

10. **Quality Control in Manufacturing**

* Defects in different factories are compared by standardizing against mean defect rates and variability of each plant.

11. **Analyzing IQ Scores Across Countries**

* Since different countries use different scales, scores are standardized (mean = 100, SD = 15) to compare cognitive ability fairly.

12. **Credit Risk Scoring in Banking**

* Applicantsâ€™ income, debt ratio, and repayment history are standardized before combining into a single credit score.

13. **Comparing Movie Ratings from Different Platforms**

* A film rated 4.2/5 on one platform and 7.8/10 on another can be standardized to see where it stands relative to each platformâ€™s average.

14. **Standardizing Clinical Trial Results**

* In a drug trial, weight loss in patients is compared across countries by standardizing results to adjust for differences in population averages.

15. **Measuring Employee Satisfaction Across Countries**

* Survey responses on a 1â€“10 scale in Country A and a 1â€“7 scale in Country B are standardized to a z-score scale for meaningful comparison.
