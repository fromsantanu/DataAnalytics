# 📊 Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test Cases

*(From Basic → Advanced Complexity)*

The **Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test** is a **non-parametric alternative to the Paired t-test**, used when comparing **two related samples** or **repeated measures on the same participants**, especially when the data are not normally distributed.

## **Level 1: Basic Everyday Contexts**

1. **Before and After Exam Preparation**

   * DV: Test Scores (%)
   * Related Samples: Same students before and after extra coaching.

2. **Weight Before and After a 4-Week Diet**

   * DV: Weight (kg)
   * Related Samples: Same individuals measured before and after the diet.

3. **Reaction Time Before and After Drinking Coffee**

   * DV: Reaction Time (seconds)

11. **Sleep Quality on Weekdays vs Weekends**

    * DV: Sleep Quality Rating (1–10)
    * Related Samples: Same participants rating weekdays vs weekends.

12. **Exam Scores with and without Practice Tests**

    * DV: Exam Marks (%)
    * Related Samples: Same students in a baseline test vs after practice tests.

---

## **Level 5: Advanced / Complex Research**

13. **Recovery Scores Before and After New Treatment**

    * DV: Health Recovery Index
    * Related Samples: Same patients before treatment and after 2 months.

14. **Driving Errors on Simulator: Day vs Night**

    * DV: Number of Driving Errors
    * Related Samples: Same participants tested in both conditions.

15. **Cognitive Performance Before and After Sleep Deprivation**

    * DV: Accuracy (%) on a memory task
    * Related Samples: Same participants tested after normal sleep vs sleep deprivation.

# ✅ Step-by-Step Structure for Students

For each case, students should follow these steps:

1. **State Hypotheses**

   * H₀: The median difference between paired scores is 0 (no effect).
   * H₁: The median difference is not 0 (there is an effect).

2. **Check Assumptions**

   * Data are paired (dependent samples).
   * DV is at least ordinal.
   * Differences are symmetrically distributed.

3. **Compute Differences**

   * Calculate difference between paired scores.
   * Remove pairs with 0 difference.

4. **Rank the Absolute Differences**

   * Assign ranks to absolute differences (ignore sign).
   * Add back the signs to create signed ranks.

5. **Calculate the Test Statistic (W)**

   * Sum of positive ranks
   * Sum of negative ranks
   * Test statistic W = smaller of these two sums

6. **Obtain p-value**

   * Compare W with critical value or use software output

7. **Decision Rule**

   * If p ≤ 0.05 → Reject H₀
   * If p > 0.05 → Fail to reject H₀

8. **Interpret Results**

   * State whether there was a significant difference between the two conditions.
   * Provide a real-world explanation.
