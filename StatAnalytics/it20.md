# üìä 15 Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) Test Cases

*(From Simple ‚Üí Advanced Complexity)*

the **Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) Test** is a **non-parametric test** that compares a sample with a reference probability distribution (often the **normal distribution**) or compares **two samples** to see if they come from the same distribution.

# ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Procedure for Students

For each case, students should follow this structured approach:

### **Step 1: State Hypotheses**

* H‚ÇÄ: The sample comes from a normal distribution.
* H‚ÇÅ: The sample does not come from a normal distribution.

### **Step 2: Check Assumptions**

* Data are continuous.
* Observations are independent.
* Sample size is adequate (n > 20 recommended).

### **Step 3: Perform K-S Test**

* Compare the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the sample with the CDF of a normal distribution with the same mean (Œº) and standard deviation (œÉ).
* Compute the maximum distance (D) between the two CDFs.

### **Step 4: Obtain Test Statistic**

* The statistic is:

  $$
  D = \max |F_n(x) - F(x)|
  $$

  where $F_n(x)$ is the empirical CDF and $F(x)$ is the theoretical CDF.

### **Step 5: Decision Rule**

* If p ‚â§ 0.05 ‚Üí Reject H‚ÇÄ (data are not normal).
* If p > 0.05 ‚Üí Fail to reject H‚ÇÄ (data are approximately normal).

### **Step 6: Interpret Results**

* Example:
  *‚ÄúThe K-S test gave D = 0.12, p = 0.18. Since p > 0.05, we fail to reject H‚ÇÄ, indicating the data do not significantly deviate from normality.‚Äù*

### **Step 7: Supplement with Visuals**

* Histogram + normal curve overlay.
* Q-Q Plot.
