4. **Studentsâ€™ exam scores in Mathematics**

   * To assess performance spread and whether scores are normally distributed.

5. **Height distribution of adult males and females separately**

   * To compare and visualize gender-based physical differences.

6. **Distribution of delivery times in an e-commerce company**

   * To check if most orders are delivered within a certain timeframe.

7. **Blood pressure readings of a health survey sample**
