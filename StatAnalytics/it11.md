# 📊 15 Repeated Measures ANOVA Cases

*(Ordered from Basic → Advanced)*

Repeated Measures ANOVA (RM-ANOVA) is a powerful test for analyzing situations where the **same participants are measured multiple times under different conditions or across time**. It controls for within-subject variability and focuses on how the dependent variable changes across repeated measures.

# ✅ Step-by-Step Structure for Students

For each case, students should practice these steps:

1. **State Hypotheses**

   * H₀: The means of the repeated measures are equal.
   * H₁: At least one mean is different.

2. **Check Assumptions**

   * Normality of differences (e.g., Shapiro-Wilk test)
   * Sphericity (Mauchly’s Test)
   * Independence of observations

3. **Perform Repeated Measures ANOVA**

   * Calculate F-statistic
   * Check p-value for main effect

4. **Decision Rule**

   * If p ≤ 0.05 → Reject H₀
   * If p > 0.05 → Fail to reject H₀

5. **Post-Hoc Analysis**

   * If significant → Pairwise comparisons with Bonferroni correction

6. **Interpret Results**

   * Explain whether the repeated measures had a significant effect
   * Link findings to the real-world context of the case
