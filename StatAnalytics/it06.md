**4. Coffee Fill: Caf√© A vs Caf√© B**
Caf√© A (n = 12) mugs have mean = 248 ml (SD = 5). Caf√© B (n = 12) mugs have mean = 252 ml (SD = 4). Test at Œ± = 0.05.

**5. Sleep Hours: Science vs Arts Students**
Science students (n = 15, mean = 6.8, SD = 0.9) vs Arts students (n = 15, mean = 7.2, SD = 1.0). Test at Œ± = 0.05.

**7. Reaction Times: Morning vs Evening Workers**
Morning workers (n = 18, mean = 250 ms, SD = 15) vs Evening workers (n = 20, mean = 265 ms, SD = 18). Test at Œ± = 0.05.

**8. Lifespan of Bulbs: Brand X vs Brand Y**
Brand X (n = 25, mean = 9,800 hrs, SD = 400) vs Brand Y (n = 28, mean = 9,950 hrs, SD = 420). Test at Œ± = 0.05.

**9. Math Test Performance: Boys vs Girls**
Boys (n = 30, mean = 74, SD = 6) vs Girls (n = 28, mean = 76, SD = 5). Test at Œ± = 0.05.

**10. Weight Loss: Diet A vs Diet B**
Diet A (n = 20, mean = 4.2 kg lost, SD = 1.0) vs Diet B (n = 20, mean = 5.0 kg lost, SD = 0.9). Test at Œ± = 0.01.

Hotel A (n = 35, mean = 8.1/10, SD = 0.8) vs Hotel B (n = 40, mean = 7.9/10, SD = 0.9). Test at Œ± = 0.05.

**14. Battery Life of Two Smartphone Models**
Model X (n = 45, mean = 19.8 hrs, SD = 1.5) vs Model Y (n = 50, mean = 20.2 hrs, SD = 1.6). Test at Œ± = 0.01.

**15. Effectiveness of Two Medications**

# ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Solution Framework (For Each Case)

1. **State Hypotheses**

   * H‚ÇÄ: Œº‚ÇÅ = Œº‚ÇÇ
   * H‚ÇÅ: Œº‚ÇÅ ‚â† Œº‚ÇÇ (two-tailed) OR Œº‚ÇÅ > Œº‚ÇÇ / Œº‚ÇÅ < Œº‚ÇÇ (one-tailed)

2. **Set the significance level (Œ±)**

3. **Compute the test statistic**

   $$
   t = \frac{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2}{\sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}}
   $$

4. **Degrees of Freedom (Welch‚Äôs formula, more general):**

   $$
   df = \frac{\left( \frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2} \right)^2}{ \frac{ \left( \frac{s_1^2}{n_1} \right)^2}{n_1 - 1} + \frac{ \left( \frac{s_2^2}{n_2} \right)^2}{n_2 - 1} }
   $$

   *(If equal variances are assumed, use df = n‚ÇÅ + n‚ÇÇ ‚àí 2.)*

5. **Find critical t-value** from t-distribution (based on df, Œ±).

6. **Decision rule**

   * Reject H‚ÇÄ if |t| > tcritical (or p < Œ±)

7. **Conclusion** in plain language.
