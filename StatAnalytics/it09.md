# ✅ Step-by-Step Structure for Students

For **each case**, students should practice the following steps:

1. **State Hypotheses**

   * Null Hypothesis (H₀): All group means are equal.
   * Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): At least one group mean differs.

2. **Check Assumptions**

   * Normality (e.g., Shapiro-Wilk test, Q-Q plot)
   * Homogeneity of variance (Levene’s Test)
   * Independence of observations

3. **Perform One-Way ANOVA**

   * Compute F-statistic
   * Obtain p-value

4. **Decision Rule**

   * If p ≤ 0.05 → Reject H₀
   * If p > 0.05 → Fail to reject H₀

5. **Post-Hoc Analysis (if significant)**

   * Use Tukey’s HSD or Bonferroni to identify specific group differences.

6. **Interpret Results**

   * Provide a plain-language conclusion connecting results to the research question.
