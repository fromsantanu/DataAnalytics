# 📊 15 Levene’s Test Cases

*(From Simple → Advanced)*

**Levene’s Test** is one of the most common tools to check the assumption of **homogeneity of variances** (equal variances across groups). It is widely used before **ANOVA, t-tests**, and other parametric tests.

## **Level 1: Basic Everyday Contexts**

1. **Exam Scores across Two Classes**

   * DV: Exam Scores (%)
   * Groups: Class A vs Class B
   * Question: Do both classes have similar score variability?

2. **Daily Exercise Duration among Age Groups**

   * DV: Minutes of Exercise
   * Groups: Young Adults, Middle-aged Adults, Seniors
   * Context: Is exercise duration spread equal across age groups?

3. **Reaction Time after Different Drinks**

   * DV: Reaction Time (seconds)
   * Groups: Water, Coffee, Energy Drink
   * Context: Is variability in reaction time equal across groups?

## **Level 2: Lifestyle & Social Contexts**

4. **Customer Satisfaction in Store Branches**

   * DV: Satisfaction Ratings (1–10 scale)
   * Groups: Branch A, Branch B, Branch C

5. **Sleep Hours for Students vs Office Workers**

   * DV: Average Hours of Sleep
   * Groups: College Students vs Full-Time Workers

6. **Monthly Household Expenditure in Different City Zones**

   * DV: Expenditure (₹)
   * Groups: North, South, East, West zones

## **Level 3: Health & Applied Research**

7. **Blood Pressure across Diet Types**

   * DV: Systolic Blood Pressure (mmHg)
   * Groups: Keto, Vegetarian, Mediterranean

8. **Pain Level Variability with Treatments**

   * DV: Pain Score (0–10)
   * Groups: Physiotherapy, Acupuncture, Painkillers

9. **BMI across Physical Activity Levels**

   * DV: BMI values
   * Groups: Low Activity, Moderate Activity, High Activity

## **Level 4: Education & Psychological Research**

10. **Test Score Variability with Teaching Methods**

    * DV: Exam Scores (%)
    * Groups: Lecture, Online, Group Discussion

11. **Stress Level Variability across Work Shifts**

    * DV: Stress Ratings (scale 1–20)
    * Groups: Day, Evening, Night Shift Workers

12. **Reaction Time Variability among Video Gamers**

    * DV: Reaction Times (ms)
    * Groups: Beginner, Intermediate, Expert

---

## **Level 5: Advanced / Complex Research**

13. **Recovery Time Variability after Surgeries**

    * DV: Days to Full Recovery
    * Groups: Knee Replacement, Hip Replacement, Spine Surgery

14. **Income Variability across Employment Sectors**

    * DV: Monthly Income (₹)
    * Groups: Public Sector, Private Sector, Self-Employed

15. **Air Quality Variability across Seasons**

    * DV: PM2.5 Concentration (µg/m³)
    * Groups: Summer, Winter, Monsoon

# ✅ Step-by-Step Approach for Students

For each case, the solution should be structured like this:

### **Step 1: State Hypotheses**

* H₀: Group variances are equal.
* H₁: At least one group has a different variance.

### **Step 2: Check Assumptions**

* DV is continuous (interval/ratio).
* Groups are independent.
* Observations are random.
* Normality is not strictly required (unlike Bartlett’s test).

### **Step 3: Compute Levene’s Test**

* Transform data into deviations from group means/medians.
* Perform ANOVA on these deviations.
* Test statistic follows an **F-distribution**.

### **Step 4: Obtain Test Statistic and p-value**

* Calculate F and compare with critical value OR
* Use software (SPSS, R, Python, Excel add-ons) for exact p-value.

### **Step 5: Decision Rule**

* If p ≤ 0.05 → Reject H₀ (variances are not equal).
* If p > 0.05 → Fail to reject H₀ (variances are equal).

### **Step 6: Interpret Results**

* Report whether groups meet the assumption of homogeneity of variances.
* Example: “Levene’s Test showed no significant difference in variances (p = 0.32), hence equal variances can be assumed.”
