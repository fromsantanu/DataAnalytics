## 🔹 Basic Level (Straightforward Mean Comparisons)

**1. Average Height of Students**
A school claims the average height of its male students is 170 cm. A random sample of 50 students has an average height of 172 cm with σ = 6 cm. Test at α = 0.05.

**2. Coffee Cup Volume**
A coffee shop claims that its large cup contains 300 ml of coffee. A sample of 40 cups shows a mean of 295 ml with σ = 10 ml. Test at α = 0.05.

**3. Exam Scores Against National Average**
The national average SAT Math score is 520. A teacher claims her class performs better. A sample of 60 students has a mean of 528, σ = 90. Test at α = 0.01.

**4. Delivery Time of Pizza**
A pizza chain promises delivery within 30 minutes. A sample of 100 deliveries has a mean of 31 minutes, σ = 5. Test if they are breaking the promise at α = 0.05.

**5. Weight of Packaged Rice**
A brand claims each rice packet weighs 5 kg. A random sample of 45 packets has a mean of 4.92 kg, σ = 0.25 kg. Test at α = 0.05.

## 🔹 Moderate Level (Directional & Real-Life Contexts)

**6. Flight Delay Times**
The average flight delay in an airport is 15 minutes. A new airline claims shorter delays. A sample of 80 flights shows a mean delay of 13 minutes, σ = 7. Test at α = 0.01.

**7. Daily Screen Time of Teenagers**
A study in 2020 found teens spend 6 hours per day on screens. A new survey of 100 teens in 2025 shows a mean of 6.5 hours, σ = 2. Test if screen time has increased (α = 0.05).

**8. Lifespan of LED Bulbs**
A company claims its LED bulbs last 10,000 hours. A test of 60 bulbs shows a mean lifespan of 9,850 hours, σ = 400 hours. Test at α = 0.05.

**9. Salary Levels vs Industry Average**
The industry average salary for software engineers is \$70,000. At a new company, 120 engineers have a mean salary of \$68,500, σ = \$5,000. Test if salaries are lower at α = 0.01.

**10. Calories in Cereal Boxes**
A cereal brand claims each serving contains 120 calories. A test of 55 servings shows a mean of 118, σ = 4. Test at α = 0.05.

## 🔹 Advanced Level (Bigger Samples, Smaller Effects, Practical Scenarios)

**11. Average Commute Time in a City**
The average commute time in a city was 45 minutes last year. A sample of 200 people this year shows a mean of 43 minutes, σ = 12. Test if commute times have changed at α = 0.05.

**12. Mobile Battery Life Claim**
A phone company claims its battery lasts 20 hours on average. A review agency tests 150 phones, mean = 19.5 hours, σ = 1.5. Test at α = 0.01.

**13. Customer Satisfaction Score**
A hotel chain claims its customer satisfaction rating is 8.0/10. A survey of 250 customers gives a mean of 7.8, σ = 1. Test at α = 0.05.

**14. Blood Pressure Medication Effect**
The average systolic blood pressure in untreated patients is 140 mmHg. A trial of 180 patients on new medication gives a mean of 137 mmHg, σ = 8. Test at α = 0.05.

**15. Annual Household Electricity Usage**
The government reports annual household electricity use at 1,200 kWh. A survey of 300 households shows a mean of 1,175 kWh, σ = 90. Test if consumption has decreased at α = 0.01.

# ✅ Suggested Step-by-Step Format for Students

For each case, students should:

1. **State the hypotheses**

   * H₀: μ = μ₀
   * H₁: μ ≠ μ₀ (two-tailed) OR μ > μ₀ / μ < μ₀ (one-tailed)

2. **Set significance level (α)**

   * Commonly 0.05 or 0.01

3. **Compute the test statistic**

   $$
   Z = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}}
   $$

4. **Find critical Z-value or p-value**

5. **Make the decision**

   * Reject H₀ if |Z| > Zcritical (or p < α).

6. **Write the conclusion in plain language**
