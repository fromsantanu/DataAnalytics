## üîπ Basic Level (Straightforward Comparisons)

**1. Male vs Female Heights**
A researcher wants to check if the average height of males (n‚ÇÅ = 60, œÉ‚ÇÅ = 7) differs from that of females (n‚ÇÇ = 70, œÉ‚ÇÇ = 6). The male sample mean is 172 cm, female sample mean 168 cm. Test at Œ± = 0.05.

**2. Exam Scores: City A vs City B**
The average math exam scores of City A students (n‚ÇÅ = 80, œÉ‚ÇÅ = 10) and City B students (n‚ÇÇ = 75, œÉ‚ÇÇ = 12) are compared. City A mean = 65, City B mean = 62. Test at Œ± = 0.05.

**3. Coffee Temperature in Two Caf√©s**
Two caf√©s claim to serve coffee at the same temperature. A sample from Caf√© A (n‚ÇÅ = 50, œÉ‚ÇÅ = 5) shows mean 70¬∞C, and Caf√© B (n‚ÇÇ = 55, œÉ‚ÇÇ = 4) shows mean 72¬∞C. Test at Œ± = 0.01.

**4. Delivery Time of Two Pizza Chains**
Chain A (n‚ÇÅ = 90, œÉ‚ÇÅ = 6) has mean delivery time = 28 minutes. Chain B (n‚ÇÇ = 100, œÉ‚ÇÇ = 7) has mean delivery time = 30 minutes. Test if there is a significant difference at Œ± = 0.05.

**5. Weights of Packaged Biscuits (Brand X vs Brand Y)**
Brand X (n‚ÇÅ = 40, œÉ‚ÇÅ = 3) has mean packet weight = 250 g. Brand Y (n‚ÇÇ = 50, œÉ‚ÇÇ = 4) has mean weight = 248 g. Test at Œ± = 0.05.

## üîπ Moderate Level (Practical Situations & Directional Tests)

**6. Flight Delays: Airline 1 vs Airline 2**
Airline 1 (n‚ÇÅ = 100, œÉ‚ÇÅ = 8) shows mean delay = 14 minutes. Airline 2 (n‚ÇÇ = 120, œÉ‚ÇÇ = 9) shows mean delay = 16 minutes. Test at Œ± = 0.05 whether Airline 1 is faster.

**7. Screen Time of Teens: Urban vs Rural**
Urban teens (n‚ÇÅ = 85, œÉ‚ÇÅ = 2.5) average 6.2 hours/day. Rural teens (n‚ÇÇ = 75, œÉ‚ÇÇ = 2.8) average 5.6 hours/day. Test if screen time differs at Œ± = 0.01.

**8. Lifespan of Bulbs from Two Brands**
Brand A (n‚ÇÅ = 60, œÉ‚ÇÅ = 300) has mean = 9,900 hrs. Brand B (n‚ÇÇ = 65, œÉ‚ÇÇ = 320) has mean = 10,050 hrs. Test if Brand B lasts longer at Œ± = 0.05.

**9. Salaries in Two Tech Companies**
Company X (n‚ÇÅ = 110, œÉ‚ÇÅ = 6,000) has mean = \$72,000. Company Y (n‚ÇÇ = 120, œÉ‚ÇÇ = 5,500) has mean = \$70,500. Test at Œ± = 0.05.

**10. Blood Pressure: Smokers vs Non-Smokers**
Smokers (n‚ÇÅ = 95, œÉ‚ÇÅ = 10) have mean = 142 mmHg. Non-smokers (n‚ÇÇ = 100, œÉ‚ÇÇ = 9) have mean = 138 mmHg. Test at Œ± = 0.01.

## üîπ Advanced Level (Large Samples & Subtle Effects)

**11. Average Commute Times: Two Cities**
City A (n‚ÇÅ = 200, œÉ‚ÇÅ = 12) mean = 44 min. City B (n‚ÇÇ = 220, œÉ‚ÇÇ = 11) mean = 47 min. Test if the commute is longer in City B at Œ± = 0.05.

**12. Battery Life of Two Smartphone Models**
Model X (n‚ÇÅ = 150, œÉ‚ÇÅ = 1.5) has mean = 19.8 hrs. Model Y (n‚ÇÇ = 160, œÉ‚ÇÇ = 1.6) has mean = 20.2 hrs. Test at Œ± = 0.01.

**13. Customer Ratings: Hotel Chain A vs Chain B**
Hotel A (n‚ÇÅ = 200, œÉ‚ÇÅ = 0.8) has mean rating = 8.1/10. Hotel B (n‚ÇÇ = 180, œÉ‚ÇÇ = 0.9) has mean rating = 7.9/10. Test at Œ± = 0.05.

**14. Annual Electricity Consumption: Urban vs Suburban**
Urban households (n‚ÇÅ = 250, œÉ‚ÇÅ = 100) mean = 1,180 kWh. Suburban households (n‚ÇÇ = 270, œÉ‚ÇÇ = 95) mean = 1,200 kWh. Test at Œ± = 0.05.

**15. Effectiveness of Two Medications**
Medication A (n‚ÇÅ = 150, œÉ‚ÇÅ = 7) reduces systolic BP to a mean of 135 mmHg. Medication B (n‚ÇÇ = 160, œÉ‚ÇÇ = 8) reduces it to 132 mmHg. Test at Œ± = 0.01 which is more effective.

# ‚úÖ Suggested Step-by-Step Format for Students

For each case, students should follow:

1. **State the hypotheses**

   * H‚ÇÄ: Œº‚ÇÅ = Œº‚ÇÇ
   * H‚ÇÅ: Œº‚ÇÅ ‚â† Œº‚ÇÇ (two-tailed) OR Œº‚ÇÅ > Œº‚ÇÇ / Œº‚ÇÅ < Œº‚ÇÇ (one-tailed)

2. **Set the significance level (Œ±)**

3. **Compute the test statistic**

   $$
   Z = \frac{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2}{\sqrt{\frac{\sigma_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{\sigma_2^2}{n_2}}}
   $$

4. **Find critical Z-value or p-value**

5. **Decision rule**

   * Reject H‚ÇÄ if |Z| > Zcritical (or p < Œ±)

6. **Conclusion in plain language**
