# 📊 15 Cases of Paired Samples T-Test

### (From Simple to Complex)

---

## 🔹 Basic Level (Simple Before–After Comparisons)

**1. Exam Prep Course Effectiveness**
10 students took a prep course. Their mean test score before was 65, and after the course it was 70 (SD of differences = 5). Test at α = 0.05.

**2. Diet Program Weight Loss**
12 people measured their weight before and after a 2‑month diet. Mean difference = −3.2 kg (SD = 1.0). Test at α = 0.05.

**3. Typing Speed Before vs After Training**
15 employees measured typing speed before training (mean = 45 WPM) and after training (mean = 50 WPM, SD of differences = 4). Test at α = 0.05.

**4. Blood Pressure Before vs After Yoga**
12 hypertensive patients measured systolic BP before yoga (mean = 148) and after 8 weeks of yoga (mean = 140, SD of differences = 7). Test at α = 0.01.

**5. Reaction Times Before vs After Coffee**
10 individuals’ reaction times measured before coffee (mean = 320 ms) and after coffee (mean = 290 ms, SD of differences = 25). Test at α = 0.05.

## 🔹 Moderate Level (Practical Interventions & Treatments)

**6. Cholesterol Levels Pre vs Post Medicine**
20 patients had cholesterol tested before treatment (mean = 220 mg/dl) and after 3 months (mean = 205 mg/dl, SD of differences = 12). Test at α = 0.05.

**7. Memory Test Before and After Sleep**
18 students took a memory recall test before sleep (mean = 22/30) and after 8 hours of sleep (mean = 25/30, SD of differences = 3). Test at α = 0.05.

**8. Pain Levels Before vs After Physiotherapy**
15 patients rated pain before physiotherapy (mean = 7/10) and after 6 sessions (mean = 5/10, SD of differences = 1.2). Test at α = 0.01.

**9. Job Satisfaction Before and After Training**
20 employees scored job satisfaction before a workshop (mean = 6.5/10) and after (mean = 7.2/10, SD of differences = 0.9). Test at α = 0.05.

**10. Pulse Rate Before vs After Meditation**
25 participants recorded pulse before meditation (mean = 80 bpm) and after 30 minutes (mean = 74 bpm, SD of differences = 4). Test at α = 0.01.

## 🔹 Advanced Level (Larger Samples & Subtle Differences)

**11. Exam Scores With vs Without Calculator**
30 students took a math test without a calculator (mean = 68) and with a calculator (mean = 72, SD of differences = 6). Test at α = 0.05.

**12. Productivity Before vs After Flexible Hours**
40 employees’ productivity measured before flexible hours (mean = 70 units/day) and after (mean = 74, SD of differences = 5). Test at α = 0.01.

**13. Blood Sugar Before vs After Exercise**
35 diabetic patients measured blood sugar before walking (mean = 160 mg/dl) and after 30 minutes of walking (mean = 150, SD of differences = 9). Test at α = 0.05.

**14. Anxiety Scores Before vs After Counseling**
50 students took an anxiety scale before counseling (mean = 18) and after 8 sessions (mean = 14, SD of differences = 4). Test at α = 0.01.

**15. Exam Performance Before vs After Online Classes**
60 students scored before online learning (mean = 65) and after 6 months (mean = 70, SD of differences = 8). Test at α = 0.05.

# ✅ Step-by-Step Framework for Students

For each case, they should:

1. **State the hypotheses**

   * H₀: μd = 0 (mean difference = 0)
   * H₁: μd ≠ 0 (two-tailed) OR μd > 0 / μd < 0 (one-tailed)

2. **Set the significance level (α)**

3. **Compute the test statistic**

   $$t = \frac{\bar{d} - 0}{s_d / \sqrt{n}}$$

   * where:

     * $\bar{d}$ = mean of the paired differences
     * $s_d$ = standard deviation of the differences
     * $n$ = number of pairs

4. **Degrees of freedom (df)**

   $$df = n - 1$$

5. **Find the critical t-value** (from t-distribution table using df & α)

6. **Decision rule**

   * Reject H₀ if |t| > tcritical (or p < α)

7. **Conclusion in plain language**
