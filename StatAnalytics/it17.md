# 📊 15 Cases of Test for Equality of Variances

*(From Basic → Advanced Complexity)*

**Tests for Equality of Variances** (also called **Homogeneity of Variance tests**) are often used before t-tests or ANOVA to check whether different groups have similar variability.
Common tests include **Levene’s Test**, **Bartlett’s Test**, and **Brown-Forsythe Test**.

## **Level 1: Basic Everyday Contexts**

1. **Exam Score Variability across Two Classes**

   * DV: Exam Scores (%)
   * Groups: Class A vs Class B
   * Question: Do both classes have similar spread in exam scores?

2. **Daily Exercise Time Variability among Age Groups**

   * DV: Minutes of Exercise
   * Groups: Young Adults, Middle-aged Adults, Seniors
   * Question: Does variability differ across age groups?

3. **Reaction Time Variability by Beverage**

   * DV: Reaction Time (seconds)
   * Groups: Water, Coffee, Energy Drink
   * Question: Is the spread of reaction times equal across groups?

## **Level 2: Lifestyle & Social Contexts**

4. **Customer Satisfaction Score Variability across Store Branches**

   * DV: Satisfaction Rating (1–10)
   * Groups: Branch A, Branch B, Branch C

5. **Sleep Hours Variability between College Students and Office Workers**

   * DV: Sleep Duration (hours)
   * Groups: Students vs Working Adults

6. **Household Monthly Expenditure Variability by City Zone**

   * DV: Monthly Expenditure (₹)
   * Groups: North Zone, South Zone, East Zone, West Zone

## **Level 3: Health & Applied Research**

7. **Blood Pressure Variability across Different Diet Types**

   * DV: Systolic BP (mmHg)
   * Groups: Keto, Vegetarian, Mediterranean

8. **Pain Level Variability across Pain Relief Treatments**

   * DV: Pain Score (0–10 scale)
   * Groups: Physiotherapy, Acupuncture, Painkillers

9. **BMI Variability by Physical Activity Level**

   * DV: BMI values
   * Groups: Low Activity, Moderate Activity, High Activity

    * Groups: Lecture, Online, Group Discussion

11. **Stress Level Variability by Work Shift**

    * DV: Stress Score (scale 1–20)
    * Groups: Day Shift, Evening Shift, Night Shift

12. **Reaction Speed Variability across Different Video Game Players**

    * DV: Reaction Time (ms)
    * Groups: Beginner, Intermediate, Expert

---

## **Level 5: Advanced / Complex Research**

13. **Recovery Time Variability after Different Surgeries**

    * DV: Days to Full Recovery
    * Groups: Knee Surgery, Hip Surgery, Spine Surgery

14. **Income Variability across Sectors**

    * DV: Monthly Income (₹)
    * Groups: Public Sector, Private Sector, Self-Employed

15. **Air Quality Measurement Variability across Seasons**

    * DV: PM2.5 Levels (µg/m³)
    * Groups: Summer, Winter, Monsoon

# ✅ Step-by-Step Structure for Students

For each case, students should practice the following procedure:

1. **State Hypotheses**

   * H₀: The variances of the groups are equal.
   * H₁: At least one group has a different variance.

2. **Check Assumptions**

   * DV is continuous.
   * Groups are independent.
   * Samples are random.
   * (For Bartlett’s Test) Normality of groups required.
   * (For Levene’s Test) More robust to non-normal data.

3. **Choose Test Method**

   * Levene’s Test (default, robust)
   * Bartlett’s Test (if data are normal)
   * Brown-Forsythe (alternative robust test)

4. **Calculate Test Statistic**

   * Use group means or medians (for robustness).
   * Compare test statistic against chi-square or F-distribution depending on the test.

5. **Obtain p-value**

   * From statistical table or software (R, SPSS, Python).

6. **Decision Rule**

   * If p ≤ 0.05 → Reject H₀ (variances differ significantly).
   * If p > 0.05 → Fail to reject H₀ (variances are equal).

7. **Interpret Results**

   * Relate findings to the real-world question (e.g., “Variability in recovery time differs significantly across surgery types”).
