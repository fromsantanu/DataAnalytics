# 📊 15 Two-Way ANOVA Test Cases

*(From Basic → Advanced)*

A **Two-Way ANOVA** involves **two independent variables (factors)** and one dependent variable. It helps test:

1. **Main effect of Factor A**
2. **Main effect of Factor B**
3. **Interaction effect (A × B)**

# ✅ Step-by-Step Structure for Students

For each case, students should follow these steps:

1. **State Hypotheses**

   * H₀₁: No main effect of Factor A
   * H₀₂: No main effect of Factor B
   * H₀₃: No interaction effect (A × B)
   * H₁: At least one main effect or interaction effect exists

2. **Check Assumptions**

   * Normality (Q-Q plot, Shapiro-Wilk)
   * Homogeneity of variances (Levene’s test)
   * Independence of observations

3. **Perform Two-Way ANOVA**

   * Compute F-statistic for Factor A, Factor B, and Interaction
   * Obtain p-values

4. **Decision Rule**

   * If p ≤ 0.05 → Reject H₀
   * If p > 0.05 → Fail to reject H₀

5. **Post-Hoc Analysis**

   * If significant main effects → Tukey’s HSD / Bonferroni tests
   * If significant interaction → Simple Effects Analysis

6. **Interpret Results**

   * Report whether each factor and their interaction significantly affected the DV
   * Provide a real-world conclusion
