# 📊 15 Shapiro-Wilk Test Cases

*(From Basic → Advanced Complexity)*

The **Shapiro-Wilk Test** is one of the most widely used statistical tests for **normality**, often used before parametric tests like **t-tests** or **ANOVA**.

## **Level 1: Basic Everyday Contexts**

1. **Exam Scores of a Small Class**

   * DV: Exam scores (%) from 20 students
   * Question: Are the scores normally distributed?

2. **Daily Exercise Minutes in a Neighborhood**

   * DV: Minutes of exercise per day from 25 people
   * Question: Is exercise time normally distributed?

3. **Reaction Times of Gamers**

   * DV: Reaction times (ms) from 30 players
   * Question: Do reaction times follow a normal distribution?

   * Question: Are stress levels normally distributed?

8. **IQ Test Results in a School**

   * DV: IQ scores of 50 students
   * Question: Do the IQ scores show a normal distribution?

9. **Reading Hours Per Week**

   * DV: Weekly reading hours of 40 students
   * Question: Do reading habits follow normality?

---

## **Level 4: Health & Applied Research**

10. **Blood Pressure Readings**

    * DV: Systolic blood pressure values from 60 adults
    * Question: Are blood pressure readings normally distributed?

11. **BMI Values in a City Survey**

    * DV: BMI values from 50 participants
    * Question: Does BMI follow a normal distribution?

12. **Pain Level Reduction after Treatment**

    * DV: Pain reduction scores (0–10 scale) from 30 patients
    * Question: Do treatment results follow normality?

---

## **Level 5: Advanced / Complex Research**

13. **Recovery Times after Different Surgeries**

    * DV: Days to recovery from 45 patients
    * Question: Are recovery times normally distributed?

14. **Monthly Income in Different Sectors**

    * DV: Monthly income from 60 individuals across sectors
    * Question: Does income distribution follow normality?

15. **Air Quality (PM2.5 Levels) across Seasons**

    * DV: Daily PM2.5 concentration over 90 days
    * Question: Is air quality data normally distributed?

# ✅ Step-by-Step Structure for Students

For each case, students should practice these steps:

### **Step 1: State Hypotheses**

* H₀: The data follow a normal distribution.
* H₁: The data do not follow a normal distribution.

### **Step 2: Check Assumptions**

* Continuous dependent variable.
* Sample size typically between 7 and 2000.
* Independent observations.

### **Step 3: Perform Shapiro-Wilk Test**

* Test statistic W is calculated based on correlation between observed data and expected normal scores.
* The software (R, Python, SPSS, etc.) provides **W** and **p-value**.

### **Step 4: Decision Rule**

* If p ≤ 0.05 → Reject H₀ (data are not normal).
* If p > 0.05 → Fail to reject H₀ (data are approximately normal).

### **Step 5: Supplement with Visualization**

* Histograms, Q-Q plots, and boxplots for confirmation.

### **Step 6: Interpret Results**

* Example:
  *“The Shapiro-Wilk Test gave W = 0.97, p = 0.21. Since p > 0.05, we fail to reject H₀. The data are approximately normally distributed.”*
