# 📊 15 Kruskal-Wallis Test Cases

*(From Basic → Advanced Complexity)*

The **Kruskal-Wallis Test** is a **non-parametric alternative to the one-way ANOVA**, used when comparing **3 or more independent groups** on a continuous or ordinal variable when normality/homoscedasticity assumptions aren’t met.

# ✅ Step-by-Step Structure for Students

For each case, students should follow this structure:

1. **State Hypotheses**

   * H₀: The distributions of the groups are the same.
   * H₁: At least one group differs from the others.

2. **Check Assumptions**

   * DV is ordinal or continuous.
   * Groups are independent.
   * Observations are randomly sampled.

3. **Rank All Data**

   * Combine all scores across groups.
   * Assign ranks (average ties).

4. **Calculate Test Statistic (H)**

   * Formula uses ranks and group sizes.
   * Larger H → greater evidence against H₀.

5. **Obtain p-value**

   * Compare H with chi-square distribution (df = k – 1).

6. **Decision Rule**

   * If p ≤ 0.05 → Reject H₀
   * If p > 0.05 → Fail to reject H₀

7. **Post-Hoc Analysis** *(if significant)*

   * Use Dunn’s test or pairwise Mann-Whitney with Bonferroni correction.

8. **Interpret Results**

   * State whether distributions differ.
   * Relate findings to real-world context.
