# üìä 15 Bartlett‚Äôs Test Cases

*(From Basic ‚Üí Advanced Complexity)*

**Bartlett‚Äôs Test** is a parametric test used to check **homogeneity of variances** across groups. It is more powerful than **Levene‚Äôs Test** when the normality assumption is met but can be sensitive to deviations from normality.

# ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Procedure for Students

For each case, students should apply the following approach:

### **Step 1: State Hypotheses**

* H‚ÇÄ: All group variances are equal.
* H‚ÇÅ: At least one group has a different variance.

### **Step 2: Check Assumptions**

* DV is continuous.
* Groups are independent.
* Each group is approximately normally distributed (important for Bartlett‚Äôs Test).

### **Step 3: Perform Bartlett‚Äôs Test**

* Test statistic is based on the ratio of the pooled variance to the individual group variances.
* Formula (conceptual):

  $$
  \chi^2 = \frac{(N-k)\ln(s_p^2) - \sum (n_i-1)\ln(s_i^2)}{C}
  $$

  where

  * $s_p^2$ = pooled variance,
  * $s_i^2$ = group variances,
  * $N$ = total sample size,
  * $k$ = number of groups,
  * $C$ = correction factor.

### **Step 4: Obtain p-value**

* Compare test statistic with chi-square distribution, df = k ‚Äì 1.

### **Step 5: Decision Rule**

* If p ‚â§ 0.05 ‚Üí Reject H‚ÇÄ (variances differ significantly).
* If p > 0.05 ‚Üí Fail to reject H‚ÇÄ (variances are equal).

### **Step 6: Interpret Results**

* Example:
  *‚ÄúBartlett‚Äôs test gave œá¬≤ = 4.12, p = 0.27. Since p > 0.05, we fail to reject H‚ÇÄ, concluding that group variances are approximately equal.‚Äù*

### **Step 7: Follow-Up**

* If variances are unequal, students should consider using:

  * Welch‚Äôs ANOVA
  * Brown-Forsythe test
  * Non-parametric tests (Kruskal-Wallis)
