## **Comparison and Ranking Heatmaps**

* **Comparison** â†’ Heatmaps let you compare across two dimensions (e.g., *days vs. hours*, *products vs. months*, *regions vs. weeks*).
* **Ranking** â†’ The color scale naturally provides a visual ranking (from lowest to highest, weakest to strongest, etc.).

#### ðŸ”¹ When to Use the Term

* Use **"Comparison Heatmap"** when the goal is to **compare** across two dimensions without emphasizing rank order (e.g., *student performance across subjects*).
* Use **"Ranking Heatmap"** when the goal is to **highlight intensity or order** (e.g., *top crime hotspots*, *peak website click zones*).
* Use **"Comparison and Ranking Heatmap"** when both aspects are important, which fits most of the 15 cases you listed.
