## ðŸ“Š 15 Cases for Measuring Dispersion

1. **Income Inequality in a City**

   * Even if the average income is high, dispersion (via Gini coefficient or SD) reveals inequality.

2. **Studentsâ€™ Exam Performance**

   * Two classes may have the same mean score, but one class may have much higher variability in marks.

3. **Daily Temperature Fluctuations**

   * Measuring spread across days helps assess climate stability in a region.

4. **Hospital Patient Recovery Times**

   * Average recovery may be similar across hospitals, but dispersion shows consistency in treatment.

5. **Investment Portfolio Risk**

   * Standard deviation of returns indicates volatility and risk in different portfolios.

6. **Blood Pressure Readings in a Health Survey**

   * Dispersion helps identify how consistent or widely spread the readings are among participants.

7. **Crop Yield Among Farmers**

   * Average yield may look stable, but dispersion highlights disparities due to soil or irrigation differences.

8. **Employee Salaries in an Organization**

   * Mean salary alone doesnâ€™t reveal fairness; dispersion shows the pay gap.

9. **Daily Sales in Retail Stores**

   * Some stores may have very stable sales, while others show wide fluctuations despite similar averages.

10. **Customer Wait Times in Banks**

* Dispersion indicates service quality consistency across branches.

11. **Lifespan of Light Bulbs from Two Manufacturers**

* Both may claim the same average life, but dispersion distinguishes reliability.

12. **Athletesâ€™ Sprint Times in a Tournament**

* Dispersion helps identify whether performance is closely competitive or widely varied.

13. **Air Pollution Levels Across Different Zones of a City**

* Measuring dispersion shows which areas deviate most from the mean pollution level.

14. **Monthly Household Expenditure in Different Regions**

* Identifies financial stability and disparity in living costs.

15. **Online Learning Test Scores Across Multiple Platforms**
