# 📊 Spearman’s Rank Correlation Cases

*(From Basic → Advanced Complexity)*

**Spearman’s Rank Correlation (ρ)** is a **non-parametric test** that measures the **strength and direction of a monotonic relationship** between two variables. It is especially useful when data are **ordinal, not normally distributed, or contain outliers**.

## **Level 1: Basic Everyday Contexts**

1. **Class Rank vs Test Rank**

   * Variables: Student class rank and exam rank
   * Context: Do higher class ranks correspond with better test ranks?

2. **Age vs Social Media Engagement Rank**

   * Variables: Age group rank and number of social media posts liked/shared
   * Context: Do younger people engage more?

3. **Daily Exercise Rank vs Stress Rank**

   * Variables: Daily exercise minutes (ranked) and stress level score (ranked)
   * Context: Is more exercise linked to less stress?

## **Level 2: Lifestyle & Health Contexts**

4. **Satisfaction Rank across Restaurants vs Price Rank**

   * Variables: Customer satisfaction rating rank and price rating rank
   * Context: Are pricier restaurants rated higher in satisfaction?

5. **Sleep Hours Rank vs Productivity Rank**

   * Variables: Self-reported sleep duration and productivity rating
   * Context: Does more sleep correlate with better productivity?

6. **Water Intake Rank vs Skin Condition Rank**

   * Variables: Liters of daily water intake and dermatologist skin health ranking
   * Context: Does more hydration improve skin health?

## **Level 3: Education & Social Contexts**

7. **Study Time Rank vs Exam Performance Rank**

   * Variables: Weekly study hours and exam marks
   * Context: Do students who study more perform better?

8. **Reading Habit Rank vs Vocabulary Test Rank**

   * Variables: Books read per month and vocabulary test score ranking
   * Context: Does reading improve vocabulary?

9. **Volunteer Hours Rank vs Happiness Rank**

   * Variables: Volunteer hours and self-rated happiness
   * Context: Does volunteering increase happiness?

## **Level 4: Research-Oriented Scenarios**

10. **BMI Rank vs Physical Fitness Rank**

    * Variables: Body Mass Index (BMI) and fitness test ranking
    * Context: Does lower BMI correspond with higher fitness levels?

11. **Blood Pressure Rank vs Age Rank**

    * Variables: Age (ranked) and blood pressure (ranked)
    * Context: Do older individuals have higher blood pressure?

12. **Work Experience Rank vs Salary Rank**

    * Variables: Years of work experience and monthly salary
    * Context: Does more experience mean a higher salary?

---

## **Level 5: Advanced / Complex Research**

13. **Air Pollution Level Rank vs Respiratory Health Rank**

    * Variables: PM2.5 levels across neighborhoods and health score rankings
    * Context: Is higher pollution linked to poorer respiratory health?

14. **Screen Time Rank vs Sleep Quality Rank**

    * Variables: Hours of daily screen use and sleep quality ratings
    * Context: Does higher screen time reduce sleep quality?

15. **Exam Anxiety Rank vs Academic Performance Rank**

    * Variables: Anxiety level ranking and academic test scores
    * Context: Does higher anxiety correspond to lower performance?

# ✅ Step-by-Step Structure for Students

For each case, students should practice these steps:

1. **State Hypotheses**

   * H₀: There is no monotonic relationship between the two variables (ρ = 0).
   * H₁: There is a monotonic relationship (ρ ≠ 0).

2. **Check Assumptions**

   * Variables are at least ordinal.
   * Relationship is monotonic (scatterplot of ranks or raw values helps).
   * Paired observations.

3. **Rank the Data**

   * Assign ranks to both variables (average ranks for ties).

4. **Compute Spearman’s ρ**

   * Formula:

     $$ρ = 1 - \frac{6 \sum d^2}{n(n^2 - 1)}$$

     where d = difference between paired ranks.

5. **Calculate Test Statistic**

   * Convert ρ to a t-value for hypothesis testing:

     $$t = ρ \sqrt{\frac{n-2}{1-ρ^2}}$$

     with df = n – 2

6. **Decision Rule**

   * If p ≤ 0.05 → Reject H₀
   * If p > 0.05 → Fail to reject H₀

7. **Interpret Results**

   * Direction: Positive (both increase), Negative (one increases, other decreases)
   * Strength (similar to Pearson):

     * 0.00–0.19 = Very weak
     * 0.20–0.39 = Weak
     * 0.40–0.59 = Moderate
     * 0.60–0.79 = Strong
     * 0.80–1.0 = Very strong

8. **Visualize**

   * Create a scatterplot of ranks to illustrate the monotonic trend.
