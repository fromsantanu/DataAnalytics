# ðŸ“˜ Sampling and Estimation: 15 Cases

### **A. Sampling Techniques**

1. **Estimating Average Daily Screen Time**

   * A university wants to estimate the average daily screen time of its students.
   * Problem: Select a random sample of 200 students and estimate the population mean with a 95% confidence interval.
   * Discuss: The effect of sample size on margin of error.

2. **Proportion of Voters Favoring a Candidate**

   * In a city of 1 million voters, estimate the proportion supporting a new candidate.
   * Problem: Use stratified random sampling across age groups and compute a 99% confidence interval.

3. **Income Distribution of a Town**

   * A survey is conducted to estimate the mean monthly income.
   * Problem: Use systematic sampling and compute a point estimate and CI for mean income.

4. **Estimating Defective Items in a Factory Batch**

   * A batch of 10,000 light bulbs is produced daily.
   * Problem: Using cluster sampling, estimate the percentage defective.

5. **Customer Satisfaction Survey**

   * A retail chain wants to know the average satisfaction rating (out of 5).
   * Problem: Use a simple random sample of receipts and estimate the mean with a margin of error Â±0.2.

### **B. Point Estimation & Interval Estimation**

6. **Estimating Average Exam Score**

   * In a class of 200 students, 40 are sampled for their exam scores.
   * Problem: Estimate the population mean score and construct a 95% CI.

7. **Estimating Proportion of Smokers in a College**

   * From a sample of 300 students, 45 report smoking.
   * Problem: Estimate the true proportion of smokers with a 90% CI.

8. **Estimating Mean Blood Pressure**

   * A hospital records the blood pressure of 50 randomly selected patients.
   * Problem: Construct both 95% and 99% CIs for the mean systolic pressure.

9. **Confidence Interval for a Difference of Means**

   * Compare mean weights of two groups: vegetarian and non-vegetarian students.
   * Problem: Estimate the difference in means and construct a 95% CI.

10. **Estimating Population Variance**

    * A company samples 60 workersâ€™ daily output.
    * Problem: Estimate the population variance of daily productivity using chi-square methods.

### **C. Advanced Cases**

11. **Estimating Proportion of Defaulters in a Bank**

    * A bank samples 500 loan accounts and finds 20 in default.
    * Problem: Estimate the proportion of defaulters and construct a 95% CI.

12. **Bootstrap Estimation**

    * A dataset of 100 salaries is available.
    * Problem: Use bootstrapping to estimate the mean salary and its confidence interval.

13. **Sample Size Determination**

    * A researcher wants to estimate the mean household expenditure within Â±â‚¹500 with 95% confidence.
    * Problem: Calculate the minimum sample size required, given Ïƒ â‰ˆ â‚¹3000.

14. **Estimating a Population Proportion with Known Margin of Error**

    * A survey aims to estimate the proportion of people favoring a new law with a margin of error â‰¤ 3%.
    * Problem: Determine the required sample size for 95% confidence.

15. **Estimation in Two-Stage Sampling**

    * In a large district, first select 10 villages, then sample 20 households per village.
    * Problem: Estimate the mean household size and construct a confidence interval.

âœ… These 15 cases cover **basic, intermediate, and advanced sampling and estimation techniques**â€”including mean, proportion, variance, sample size determination, and confidence intervals. They can be used for exercises, projects, or even small group assignments.
