# **Survival Analysis of Stage IV Colorectal Cancer Patients Receiving Immunotherapy**

---

## üìå **Project Overview:**

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is among the most prevalent and deadly cancers globally. While early-stage CRC has relatively good prognosis, **Stage IV (metastatic) CRC** presents a serious survival challenge. Immunotherapy is emerging as a treatment option, especially for patients with high microsatellite instability (MSI-H). This project aims to perform a **survival analysis** on a cohort of Stage IV CRC patients undergoing immunotherapy to evaluate key survival determinants and estimate overall and progression-free survival.

---

## üéØ **Objectives:**

1. Estimate **survival probability** and **median survival time** of Stage IV CRC patients.
2. Identify **clinical and demographic factors** that significantly impact survival outcomes.
3. Compare survival curves between **treatment groups** (e.g., immunotherapy vs. standard chemotherapy).
4. Use **Cox Proportional Hazards Model** to assess the effect of covariates on survival.
5. Evaluate **progression-free survival (PFS)** and **overall survival (OS)** rates.

### üìÇ **Data Requirements:**

You can use real-world data from sources like:

* SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) database
* TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas)
* Hospital cancer registries or trials like CheckMate-142

**Key variables:**

* Patient ID
* Age at diagnosis
* Gender
* Tumor location (colon/rectum)
* Histological type
* MSI status (MSI-H/MSS)
* Type of treatment (Immunotherapy, Chemotherapy, Combination)
* Date of diagnosis
* Date of treatment start
* Date of last follow-up
* Survival status (alive/deceased)
* Date of death (if applicable)
* Progression event (Yes/No) and progression date

---

### üõ†Ô∏è **Methods & Tools:**

* Kaplan-Meier Estimator (KM curves)
* Log-rank test (for comparing survival curves)
* Cox Proportional Hazards Model (for multivariate analysis)
* R (`survival`, `survminer` packages) or Python (`lifelines`, `scikit-survival`)

---

### üìà **Key Visualizations:**

1. **KM plots** comparing different treatment groups.
2. **Forest plot** of hazard ratios from Cox model.
3. **Time-dependent ROC** to assess model performance.
4. **Risk tables** under KM plots to show patient counts.

---

### ‚úÖ **Expected Outcomes:**

* Identify whether immunotherapy significantly improves survival in Stage IV CRC patients.
* Quantify hazard ratios for key variables (e.g., age, MSI status, treatment type).
* Provide actionable insights for oncologists and policy makers regarding treatment strategy.

---

### üîç **Why this project matters:**

* CRC is the **third most common cancer worldwide**.
* The rise of **immunotherapy** has changed treatment paradigms‚Äîreal-world evidence is urgently needed.
* This project combines epidemiology, biostatistics, and medical decision support in a real-world context.
