# **Impact of PM2.5 Exposure on Respiratory Health Among Residents of Delhi, India**

---

## üìò **Background & Rationale:**

Delhi is one of the most polluted cities in the world, frequently recording **PM2.5 (particulate matter ‚â§2.5 microns)** levels far above the safe limits prescribed by the WHO. PM2.5 particles are especially dangerous because they can penetrate deep into the lungs and even enter the bloodstream, causing **chronic respiratory illnesses, cardiovascular diseases, and decreased lung function**.

Despite several public health warnings, **quantitative assessments of long-term health outcomes** in Delhi‚Äôs population due to PM2.5 exposure are still limited in scope and rigor.

---

## üéØ **Research Objective:**

To investigate the **correlation between long-term exposure to PM2.5** and the **prevalence of respiratory illnesses (e.g., asthma, chronic bronchitis, COPD)** among residents of Delhi across different age groups and zones of the city.

---

## ‚ùì **Research Questions:**

1. What is the average annual exposure to PM2.5 in various zones of Delhi (North, South, East, West, Central)?
2. How does the prevalence of respiratory symptoms (cough, wheezing, shortness of breath) vary across these zones?
3. Is there a significant association between high PM2.5 exposure and the diagnosis of chronic respiratory diseases?
4. Are certain demographics (children, elderly, outdoor workers) more affected than others?

## üßæ **Study Design:**

* **Type:** Cross-sectional analytical study with environmental exposure overlay
* **Location:** Multiple wards in Delhi categorized by air quality index (AQI) data
* **Sample Size:** 1000 participants (random sampling from each ward)
* **Data Sources:**

  * Air quality data from CPCB and SAFAR
  * Health surveys and clinical data collection
  * Government hospital and clinic records

---

### üîç **Key Variables:**

* **Independent Variable:** Average PM2.5 exposure per zone (Œºg/m¬≥)
* **Dependent Variables:**

  * Frequency of respiratory symptoms
  * Diagnosed respiratory illness (clinical reports)
  * Medication usage (inhalers, steroids)
* **Control Variables:**

  * Smoking status
  * Occupational exposure
  * Age, gender
  * Pre-existing health conditions

---

### üìä **Expected Analysis:**

* Descriptive statistics (mean, SD, prevalence)
* ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis to compare means across zones
* Logistic regression to assess the effect of PM2.5 on likelihood of having respiratory disease
* GIS-based mapping to show health risk zones

---

### üìà **Anticipated Outcomes:**

* Identification of high-risk zones within Delhi
* Quantitative estimate of increased risk of respiratory disease per unit increase in PM2.5
* Policy implications for air quality improvement and health surveillance

## **Detailed Excel schema** 

This schema is structured into **6 logical sheets/tables**, which you can represent either in a single workbook with multiple sheets or as a master table using a single sheet with combined columns.
