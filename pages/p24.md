# **Comparative Effectiveness Study of Two Treatment Methods for Lower Back Pain in a Controlled Environment**

## **Background**

Lower back pain (LBP) is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide, affecting quality of life and work productivity. Multiple treatment modalities are available, but evidence is often inconsistent regarding which method provides the most effective and sustainable relief. A controlled comparative study is required to evaluate the effectiveness of two treatment methods (e.g., **Conventional Physiotherapy** vs. **Exercise-Based Therapy with Cognitive Behavioral Support**) under standardized conditions.

## **Objective**

To compare the effectiveness of two treatment methods for lower back pain by analyzing clinical, functional, and patient-reported outcomes collected in a controlled trial environment.

## **Research Questions**

1. Which treatment method provides greater pain relief as measured by standardized pain scales?
2. Do the treatments differ in improving functional ability and mobility?
3. What are the short-term vs. long-term differences in outcomes between the two methods?
4. Are there variations in patient satisfaction and adherence between the two groups?

## **Hypothesis**

* **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** There is no significant difference in the effectiveness of the two treatment methods for lower back pain.
* **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):** One treatment method is significantly more effective than the other in reducing pain and improving functional outcomes.

## **Methodology**

* **Study Design:** Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT)
* **Population:** Adults aged 25–65 diagnosed with chronic lower back pain (>3 months)
* **Sample Size:** 200 participants (100 in each treatment group)
* **Treatment Groups:**

  * **Group A:** Standard Physiotherapy
  * **Group B:** Exercise-Based Therapy + Cognitive Behavioral Support
* **Duration:** 12 weeks of treatment + 12-week follow-up
* **Data Collection:**

  * Baseline assessments
  * Weekly progress reports
  * Post-treatment evaluation
  * Follow-up at 3 months

## **Data Collected**

* **Clinical Measures:** Pain intensity (VAS score), muscle strength, range of motion
* **Functional Measures:** Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), timed mobility tests
* **Patient-Reported Outcomes:** Quality of life (SF-36), treatment satisfaction, adherence rates
* **Safety Outcomes:** Incidence of adverse events

## **Analysis Plan**

* Descriptive statistics for baseline comparison
* Paired and independent sample t-tests for pain score changes
* Repeated measures ANOVA for longitudinal comparisons
* Regression models to adjust for confounders (age, sex, baseline severity)
* Effect size and clinical significance evaluation
* Kaplan-Meier analysis for adherence/dropout rates

## **Expected Outcomes**

* Identification of the more effective treatment method for reducing pain and disability
* Evidence-based recommendations for clinical practice guidelines
* Insights into patient adherence and satisfaction with different treatment modalities

## **Deliverables**

* Comprehensive statistical analysis report
* Comparative effectiveness chart and tables
* Recommendations for healthcare providers and policymakers
* Publication-ready manuscript
