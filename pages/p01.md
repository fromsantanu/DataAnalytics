# Epidemiologycal Study of Frequent Allergy Attacks Recorded In a Samll Town

### **Epidemiological Survey: Detailed Plan**

#### **Objective**

To collect systematic data on the prevalence, distribution, and potential causes of allergies among people in different areas of the city.

---

#### **1. Study Design: Cross-Sectional Survey**

* **Definition:**
  A cross-sectional survey captures data at a single point in time from a population to understand the current status of a health issue.

* **Why this design?**

  * It is cost-effective and time-efficient.
  * Suitable for assessing prevalence and identifying associations between variables.

---

#### **2. Sampling Strategy**

* **Define the target population:**
  Residents of the city across different age groups, genders, and occupations.

* **Sampling method:**

  * Stratified random sampling to ensure representation from:

    * Different localities (urban, semi-urban, slums, industrial areas, green zones).
    * Various socio-economic groups.
  * Calculate an adequate sample size for statistical significance using standard formulas based on estimated prevalence rates.

---

#### **3. Data Collection Tools**

* **Develop a structured questionnaire** including:

  * **Demographic details:** age, gender, occupation, education, income level.

  * **Health information:**

    * Symptoms (sneezing, itching, rashes, breathing difficulties, watery eyes).
    * Duration (how long they have been experiencing symptoms).
    * Severity (mild, moderate, severe; frequency per week or month).
    * History of similar symptoms in past years.

  * **Exposure assessment:**

    * Proximity to pollution sources (factories, construction sites, heavy traffic roads).
    * Indoor environment (pets, carpets, damp walls, air conditioning).
    * Lifestyle factors (smoking, cooking fuel type, time spent outdoors).
    * Food habits (recent change in diet, known food allergies).

  * **Medical history:**

    * Any prior diagnosis of allergies or asthma.
    * Medications currently being taken.

---

#### **4. Pilot Testing**

* Conduct a small pilot survey with \~20 respondents to:

  * Ensure clarity and appropriateness of questions.
  * Test average time taken to fill the questionnaire.
  * Refine wording or structure based on pilot feedback.

---

#### **5. Data Collection Procedure**

* **Mode:** Face-to-face interviews by trained field investigators OR self-administered forms if literacy levels are high.
* **Ethics:** Obtain informed consent, ensure confidentiality, and follow ethical guidelines approved by an Institutional Ethics Committee.
* **Timeline:** Plan data collection over 2-4 weeks to cover all sampled areas.

---

#### **6. Data Management**

* Enter data into a centralised database (Excel, SPSS, or any data entry software).
* Perform data cleaning (check for missing values, inconsistencies).

---

#### **7. Data Analysis Plan**

* Calculate prevalence rates of allergies overall and by area, age group, gender, occupation, etc.
* Identify associations between exposures (e.g. living near construction) and allergy symptoms using chi-square tests or logistic regression.

---

#### **8. Reporting Results**

* Prepare tables and graphs showing:

  * Prevalence by locality and demographics.
  * Common symptoms and severity distribution.
  * Significant associations with environmental or lifestyle factors.

---
