# üìë **Clinical Trial Data Analysis in Drug Discovery**

## üéØ Project Objective

To analyze clinical trial data for a new drug candidate in order to assess its efficacy, safety, and tolerability among diverse patient groups, and to generate actionable insights that will guide regulatory approval and post-marketing strategies.

---

## üî¨ Scope of the Project

* Focused exclusively on **clinical trial stage analysis** (Phase I‚ÄìIII).
* Evaluation of:

  1. **Efficacy** ‚Äì how well the drug works in treating the target condition.
  2. **Safety** ‚Äì monitoring adverse events and toxicity signals.
  3. **Subgroup Responses** ‚Äì identifying which patient groups benefit most or face higher risks.
  4. **Comparative Effectiveness** ‚Äì how the new drug performs against standard treatments or placebo.

---

## üìä Key Research Questions

1. What is the **overall efficacy** of the drug compared to placebo or standard treatment?
2. What is the **incidence and severity of adverse events** in the study population?
3. How does **efficacy and safety vary** across different age, gender, and comorbidity groups?
4. What is the **time-to-event outcome** (e.g., remission, relapse, or survival)?
5. Are there **predictors of response or adverse events** that can guide personalized medicine?
