# 📑 **Clinical Trial Data Analysis in Drug Discovery**

## 🎯 Project Objective

To analyze clinical trial data for a new drug candidate in order to assess its efficacy, safety, and tolerability among diverse patient groups, and to generate actionable insights that will guide regulatory approval and post-marketing strategies.

---

## 🔬 Scope of the Project

* Focused exclusively on **clinical trial stage analysis** (Phase I–III).
* Evaluation of:

  1. **Efficacy** – how well the drug works in treating the target condition.
  2. **Safety** – monitoring adverse events and toxicity signals.
  3. **Subgroup Responses** – identifying which patient groups benefit most or face higher risks.
  4. **Comparative Effectiveness** – how the new drug performs against standard treatments or placebo.

---

## 📊 Key Research Questions

1. What is the **overall efficacy** of the drug compared to placebo or standard treatment?
2. What is the **incidence and severity of adverse events** in the study population?
3. How does **efficacy and safety vary** across different age, gender, and comorbidity groups?
4. What is the **time-to-event outcome** (e.g., remission, relapse, or survival)?
5. Are there **predictors of response or adverse events** that can guide personalized medicine?

## 📈 Analytical Methods

* **Descriptive Statistics**: Baseline patient characteristics, dropout rates.
* **Efficacy Analysis**:

  * T-tests / ANOVA for continuous outcomes (e.g., blood pressure reduction).
  * Logistic regression for binary outcomes (e.g., remission yes/no).
* **Safety Analysis**:

  * Frequency and severity of adverse events.
  * Chi-square tests for categorical comparisons.
* **Survival & Time-to-Event Analysis**:

  * Kaplan–Meier curves to visualize survival or remission.
  * Cox proportional hazards model for hazard ratios.
* **Subgroup Analysis**:

  * Stratified analysis by age, gender, comorbidities.
* **Machine Learning (Optional)**: Predictive modeling for responders vs. non-responders.

## 📑 Deliverables / Reports

1. **Patient Profile Report** – demographics and baseline characteristics.
2. **Efficacy Report** – statistical results of primary and secondary endpoints.
3. **Safety Report** – tables and charts of adverse events and lab results.
4. **Survival Analysis Report** – Kaplan–Meier plots with hazard ratios.
5. **Subgroup Response Report** – comparative charts for age/gender groups.
6. **Final Clinical Analysis Report** – integrated summary for regulatory submission.

## 🕒 Expected Timeline

* **Week 1–2**: Data cleaning & preparation
* **Week 3–4**: Descriptive & efficacy analysis
* **Week 5–6**: Safety and adverse event analysis
* **Week 7–8**: Survival & subgroup analysis
* **Week 9**: Drafting reports and executive summary
* **Week 10**: Final review and submission

👉 This project stage is **crucial for FDA/EMA approval** — data must be accurate, statistically valid, and clearly presented.
