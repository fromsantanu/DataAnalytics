# **Comparative Performance Assessment of a Student in Multi-Subject Examinations**

### **1. Project Objective**

This project evaluates the performance of a student in one or more chosen subjects — **English, Science, and Mathematics** — based on cognitive and brain function parameters. The assessment measures performance against **standard benchmarks** set by the examining authority and provides a **comparative view** with peer examinees. The outcomes will be consolidated into **subject-wise detailed reports** and an **overall performance report** including SWOT analysis and actionable recommendations.
