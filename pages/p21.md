# ðŸ“Œ Study Design for Dementia Progression & Risk Factors in India

## 1. **Study Type**

* **Prospective cohort study (preferred)**

  * Recruit participants from several regions and follow them over time to see how dementia develops and progresses.
* **Nested case-control study (within the cohort)**

  * Compare dementia cases vs. non-cases in the same cohort to identify risk factors more efficiently.
* If resources are limited â†’ a **cross-sectional baseline study** with follow-up waves every few years.

---

## 2. **Study Population**

* **Target age group**: e.g., adults â‰¥60 years.
* **Regions**: Choose both urban and rural sites across different states to capture diversity (North, South, East, West, NE India).
* **Sample size**: Determined by power analysis, ensuring enough participants for subgroup analysis.

**Inclusion criteria**

* People â‰¥ target age
* Residents of the selected regions â‰¥5 years
* Consent to participate

**Exclusion criteria**

* Severe comorbidities preventing assessment
* Non-consent or communication barriers without caregiver support

## 3. **Data Collection Framework**

### A. **Baseline Data**

* **Demographics**: Age, sex, education, occupation, socioeconomic status
* **Lifestyle & behavior**: Diet, physical activity, alcohol/tobacco, social engagement
* **Medical history**: Hypertension, diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, head trauma
* **Family history**: Dementia, psychiatric disorders
* **Environmental exposure**: Air pollution, pesticides, occupational hazards

### B. **Cognitive & Clinical Assessment**

* **Neuropsychological tests**: Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE), MoCA (Montreal Cognitive Assessment)
* **Functional assessment**: ADL/IADL (Activities of Daily Living)
* **Clinical diagnosis**: Following DSMâ€‘5 or ICDâ€‘10 criteria

### C. **Biological & Imaging Data (if feasible)**

* Blood tests: glucose, cholesterol, vitamin B12, thyroid function
* Genetic markers: APOE if ethical & feasible
* Neuroimaging (subset): MRI/PET to detect brain changes

### D. **Follow-Up Data**

* Reassess cognition every 1â€“2 years
* Record incidence of dementia and track progression (mild â†’ moderate â†’ severe)
* Document mortality and comorbidities

---

## 4. **Study Design Features**

* **Multicentric approach**: Regional centers (medical colleges/research institutes) coordinate under a central authority (e.g., ICMR).
* **Standardized protocols**: Same tools, training, and data collection formats across all regions.
* **Longitudinal design**: Follow participants for 5â€“10 years to capture progression.
* **Data linkage**: With hospital/healthcare records for confirmation of diagnoses.
* **Use of control group**: Age-matched individuals without dementia for risk factor comparison.

---

## 5. **Statistical & Analytical Plan**

* **Descriptive analysis** â†’ Prevalence and incidence of dementia by region & age group
* **Survival analysis (Cox regression)** â†’ Time to onset of dementia
* **Logistic regression** â†’ Identify risk factors (e.g., diabetes, education level, smoking)
* **Multilevel modeling** â†’ Account for regional variations
* **SWOT analysis** â†’ Summarize findings for policy (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats)

---

## 6. **Outputs & Reports**

* **Regional prevalence maps** of dementia
* **Risk factor associations** (graphs & odds ratios)
* **Progression curves** (Kaplanâ€“Meier survival plots)
* **Age & gender stratified reports**
* **Policy briefs** â†’ Recommendations for prevention and care in India

---

## 7. **Ethical & Logistical Considerations**

* Informed consent (with caregiver support if needed)
* Confidentiality of medical & genetic data
* Translation of instruments into regional languages
* Training of field investigators for consistency
* Collaboration with **ICMR, NIMHANS, and state health departments**

---

âœ… **In summary:**
The ideal design is a **multicentric, prospective cohort study** with regular follow-ups, standardized cognitive assessments, and collection of lifestyle, medical, and biological data. This will allow you to study **both the progression of dementia and the risk factors contributing to it across India**.
