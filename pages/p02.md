# **An Investigative Study on the Rising Incidence of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus among Urban Adults: Causes, Consequences, and Preventive Strategies**

---

### üîç **Background:**

Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is one of the most prevalent lifestyle diseases globally. Sedentary habits, poor diet, stress, and lack of physical activity are major contributors. The disease has a profound impact not only on health but also on the economy and quality of life.

---

### üéØ **Objectives:**

1. To assess the prevalence of T2DM in a selected urban population.
2. To identify lifestyle factors contributing to the onset of the disease.
3. To study the awareness levels regarding prevention and management.
4. To propose lifestyle modifications based on collected data.

### üìã **Methodology:**

#### 1. **Study Design:**

* Cross-sectional descriptive study
* Target population: Adults aged 30‚Äì60 in an urban locality

#### 2. **Sample Size:**

  * Blood glucose (FBS/RBS/HbA1c)
  * BMI and waist-hip ratio

#### 4. **Data Analysis:**

* Use statistical software (e.g., SPSS, R, Excel)
* Analyze correlation between lifestyle factors and diabetes prevalence
* Use chi-square test, t-tests, or logistic regression where applicable

---

### üìä **Expected Outcomes:**

* Patterns of lifestyle behavior linked to increased risk
* Proportion of undiagnosed cases
* Awareness gaps
* Recommendation of preventive actions (diet, exercise, screening)

### üí° Tips:

* **Primary Key**: `Participant_ID` is your key to uniquely identify rows.
* **Normalization** (optional): You can split `Lifestyle`, `Family_History`, and `Clinical_Data` into separate tables/entities for cleaner relational design.
* You can also use **coded values** or **scales (e.g., 1‚Äì5)** for analysis instead of strings.
