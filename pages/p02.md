# **Epidemiological Study of Dengue Fever in Urban and Semi-Urban Regions of India**

---

## üéØ **Project Objectives:**

1. **Estimate the incidence and prevalence** of Dengue in selected regions.
2. **Identify demographic, environmental, and behavioral risk factors** associated with dengue infection.
3. **Analyze seasonal and climatic trends** affecting dengue outbreaks.
4. **Evaluate knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP)** regarding dengue prevention.
5. **Assess the effectiveness** of public health interventions (e.g., fogging, larvicide use, awareness campaigns).
6. **Recommend strategies** for targeted control and prevention programs.
