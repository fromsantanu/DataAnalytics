# **An Investigative Study on the Rising Incidence of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus among Urban Adults: Causes, Consequences, and Preventive Strategies**

---

### üîç **Background:**

Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is one of the most prevalent lifestyle diseases globally. Sedentary habits, poor diet, stress, and lack of physical activity are major contributors. The disease has a profound impact not only on health but also on the economy and quality of life.

---

### üéØ **Objectives:**

1. To assess the prevalence of T2DM in a selected urban population.
2. To identify lifestyle factors contributing to the onset of the disease.
3. To study the awareness levels regarding prevention and management.
4. To propose lifestyle modifications based on collected data.

### üìã **Methodology:**

#### 1. **Study Design:**

* Cross-sectional descriptive study
* Target population: Adults aged 30‚Äì60 in an urban locality

#### 2. **Sample Size:**

* Random sampling of 200 individuals

#### 3. **Data Collection Tools:**

* Structured questionnaire covering:

  * Demographics (age, gender, occupation, income)

### üí° Tips:

* **Primary Key**: `Participant_ID` is your key to uniquely identify rows.
* **Normalization** (optional): You can split `Lifestyle`, `Family_History`, and `Clinical_Data` into separate tables/entities for cleaner relational design.
* You can also use **coded values** or **scales (e.g., 1‚Äì5)** for analysis instead of strings.


# **key observations and relationships** 

From a well-designed survey using this schema for investigating Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), you'll likely uncover important statistical relationships and patterns between lifestyle choices, demographic factors, and diabetes prevalence.

---

## üîç **Likely Observations & Relationships**

### 1. **Lifestyle Factors & Diabetes**

* **Higher prevalence of diabetes** among participants who:

  * Have **sedentary lifestyles**
  * **Consume junk food** more frequently
  * Have **high sugar intake**
  * **Sleep less than 6 hours** or more than 9 hours per day
  * Report **high stress levels** (score 7‚Äì10)
* **Inverse relationship** between **exercise time** and diabetes (i.e., more exercise ‚Üí lower risk)

---

### 2. **Obesity & Body Metrics**

* Participants with **higher BMI** and **waist-hip ratio** are more likely to:

  * Be **pre-diabetic** or **diagnosed with T2DM**
  * Show **higher HbA1c and fasting glucose levels**
* Central obesity (high waist-hip ratio) is often **more predictive** than general obesity (BMI)

---

### 3. **Demographics & Risk Levels**

* **Age:** Prevalence increases with age, especially after 40
* **Gender:** May show slightly higher prevalence among **females** (depending on population and lifestyle)
* **Income and education levels:**

  * Lower income groups might show higher prevalence due to **poor diet awareness and health access**
  * Education might be **protective** due to better awareness and self-care practices

---

### 4. **Family History & Genetic Susceptibility**

* Participants with **family history of diabetes** show:

  * **Higher rates of diagnosis**
  * **Younger age at onset**
  * **Faster progression** from pre-diabetic to diabetic stage

---

### 5. **Smoking, Alcohol & Diabetes**

* Regular **smoking** may show a moderate association with diabetes due to insulin resistance
* **Heavy alcohol consumption** may correlate with liver-related metabolic issues and **glucose dysregulation**

---

### 6. **Awareness & Prevention Behavior**

* Many diagnosed participants may:

  * Be **unaware of complications** (e.g., vision loss, kidney failure)
  * **Not participate in regular screening**
  * **Lack motivation to change lifestyle**, even when advised
* High awareness levels often **coincide** with better glucose control and **fewer complications**

---

### 7. **Psychosocial Aspects**

* **High stress** and **poor sleep quality** show strong associations with both:

  * **Elevated blood sugar levels**
  * **Poor adherence** to lifestyle changes or medications

---

### 8. **Comorbidity Clusters**

* You may observe clustering of:

  * **High BMI + Stress + Poor diet + Lack of exercise** ‚Üí strong diabetes risk group
  * **Education + Physical activity + Awareness** ‚Üí low-risk group

---

## üìä Statistical Tests You Can Use:

* **Chi-square test**: To test associations between categorical variables (e.g., Family History vs. Diagnosed Diabetes)
* **T-tests or ANOVA**: To compare means (e.g., Average HbA1c among smokers vs. non-smokers)
* **Correlation**: Between continuous variables (e.g., Stress Level vs. HbA1c)
* **Logistic Regression**: To predict likelihood of having diabetes based on lifestyle and health metrics

---

## üéØ Insights You Can Use:

* Identify **modifiable risk factors** to design awareness campaigns
* Detect **early risk groups** for targeted intervention
* Recommend **community-based lifestyle improvement strategies**
* Present findings to **health policy makers or NGOs**
